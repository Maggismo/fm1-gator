# Developing on the platform

GATOR is one app on a small firmware platform for the FM-1 (JieLi AC79, pi32v2 core), cut down from
[ORBIT](https://github.com/dspaudio/orbit) (ORBIT ← SLOOP ← Felucca). The hardware-proven parts are kept: the HAL,
the update loader, USB-MIDI, OTA, flash storage and the `.fwsc` packer. Everything else is a thin API for apps.

| | |
|---|---|
| Screen | ST7789 240×240 RGB565, drawn in strips through a canvas of up to 240×124 (no frame buffer) |
| Audio | I2S stereo at 44.1 kHz (or 48 kHz with `--fs 48`), `app_audio()` called from the interrupt for 256 frames (5.8 ms) |
| Input | 27 note keys, 14 buttons, 7 encoders, the MASTER pot, the battery |
| LEDs | under every key and button |
| MIDI | USB-MIDI in / out, TRS MIDI IN (3.5 mm) |
| Storage | 2 slots of 3840 B in flash, A/B writes with CRC (a power loss keeps the last copy) |
| Update | OTA over USB-MIDI with `tools/fm1_install.py` or the web installer, no programmer |
| Safety | watchdog, boot-loop guard → USB RESCUE, crash screen with PC / vector, stack guards |

## Layout

```
firmware/
  apps/NAME/         one folder per app (build: --app NAME)
    app.c            app_init / app_frame / app_audio
    *.cc             C++ (optional): built separately, with the FPU
    third_party.txt  the third_party/ folders to build with the app
    name.txt         the name on the splash (default FM-1 PLAYGROUND)
    logo.png         the splash logo, any size: tools/gen_logo.py fits it into 240×240, 256 colours
  cxx/               minimal <algorithm> / <cmath> / <new> and the C++ runtime (the toolchain has none)
  sys/               the system layer
    fw.h             the app API (types, constants, buttons, encoders)
    fw.c             the translation unit (unity build): the include order matters
    main.c           start, main loop, TIMER5, crash screen, UBOOT
    audio.c          the I2S interrupt → app_audio, CPU load
    input.c          buttons / encoders / keys → fw_input_t, LEDs, MIDI API
    flash.c          flash driver, storage slots, OTA hooks
    gfx.c lcd.c      canvas, fonts, ST7789

  app.ld crt0.S      memory map and entry
host/                the simulator: the same app code on macOS / Linux → WAV and PNG
third_party/         external sources (eurorack/: the Plaits DSP and stmlib, MIT; PATCHES.md lists the changes)
tools/               build.py, release.py, generators, fm1_install.py, sim.py, sdk/ (JieLi files, Apache-2.0)
web/                 the web installer and its site builder
```

## App API

An app is a folder `firmware/apps/NAME/` with an `app.c` (it may `#include` its own `.c` files) and three functions:

```c
static void app_init(void);                           // once, before the audio starts
static void app_frame(const fw_input_t *in);          // main loop, ~66 Hz
static void app_audio(int32_t *lr, uint32_t frames);  // INTERRUPT: frames = 256, LRLR…, ±32767
```

`fw_input_t`, per frame:

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `ms` | milliseconds since start |
| `held / pressed / released` | button masks, `FW_BIT(FW_BTN_PLAY)` etc. |
| `keys / keys_pressed / keys_released` | masks of the 27 keys (bit 0 = F3 = MIDI 53, `FW_KEY_BASE_NOTE`) |
| `knob[FW_KNOB_*]` | encoder detents since the last frame (+ = clockwise) |
| `master` | the pot, 0..1023 |
| `battery` | raw battery ADC |

Buttons: `FX SCL ENV LFO EDIT GLO HOME SAVE ARP SEQ PLAY REC OCT_DOWN OCT_UP`.
Encoders: `SELECT ALGO PRESET 1 2 3 4`.

```c
fw_led_button(FW_BTN_PLAY, on);   fw_led_note_key(k, on);   fw_leds_keys(mask);
fw_midi_read(&m) -> 0/1           fw_midi_send(status, d1, d2)        // main loop only
fw_store_load(slot, dst, max)     fw_store_save(slot, src, len)       // 2 slots × 3840 B
fm1_irq_off() / fm1_irq_on()      // critical section against app_audio (main loop only)
fw_stats.cpu_q8                   // audio interrupt load, 256 = 100%
FW_NOTE_INC[note]                 // uint32 phase increment of a MIDI note at FW_FS
FW_SINE[FW_SINE_N]                // int16 sine, 1024 points
```

Drawing (`gfx.c`): `lcd_fill(x, y, w, h, color)`, `draw_text_box(x, y, w, &FONT_S, "txt", color, align)`, and for
graphics the canvas: `cv_begin(w, h, bg)` → `cv_text / cv_rect / cv_line / cv_pset` → `cv_blit(x, y)`. The canvas is
at most 240×124, so a screen is drawn in strips. Fonts: `FONT_S` (16 px), `FONT_L` (32 px). Colours: `RGB(r, g, b)`,
`C_BLACK C_WHITE C_HI C_GRAY C_DIM C_ACCENT`.

## Rules

- **`app_audio` is an interrupt.** No drawing, flash, waiting or `fw_midi_send` there. The budget is 5.8 ms for 256
  frames; watch `fw_stats.cpu_q8`.
- **float only in C++.** The C side (`fw.c` and `app.c`) is built without the FPU, as ORBIT is, where `float` would
  be slow software emulation (the build fails if any is linked). `*.cc` files are built with the single-precision
  FPU (`-mcpu=r3 -mfprev1`, as the AC79 SDK); call them from C through `extern "C"` with integers and pointers
  (`apps/gator/macro.h`). The FPU has no `double`. Static constructors do not run: create such objects with
  placement new in `app_init` (the build fails on `.init_array`).
- **Do not block `app_frame` for more than a few seconds:** the watchdog (~8 s) restarts the device.
- No `malloc` and no libc: static buffers only. Mark large buffers `FW_POOL` (336 KB, ~58 KB of it the canvas; the
  build keeps 8 KB free).
- Hardware registers only in `hal/`. `build.py` fails on MMIO addresses, `volatile` casts or inline asm in `sys/`,
  `apps/`, `loader/`.
- `fw_store_save` erases a sector with interrupts off: the sound stops meanwhile. Do not save while playing.
- During an update `app_audio` is not called (`fw_audio_hold`): the update gets the whole CPU.
- The ALNK interrupt is acknowledged **before** the render (`sys/audio.c`, as ChoralRoot 0.18): otherwise a render
  that ends after the buffer boundary eats the next interrupt and the DMA repeats the old half.
- At start the VDC14 / SYSVDD supplies are raised to M-VAVE's stock levels (`fm1_supplies_stock`, from SLOOP 2.7 /
  X0X 1.0.9): at the loader's levels some units misread flash and SRAM.

The package format, the loader and the OTA protocol are those of SLOOP / ORBIT, so GATOR installs and is replaced
the same way they are. The USB descriptors stay Felucca's (VID:PID 1209:0001, "Felucca") so that the installers find
the device.

| If | Then |
|---|---|
| the firmware crashes at start | after 2 failed boots in a row **USB RESCUE** starts (no sound): install a working package |
| you need RESCUE by hand | hold **OCT−** at power-on |
| UBOOT (JieLi's ROM loader) | hold **OCT− + OCT+** for 5 seconds, or SysEx `F0 22 24 35 7D F7` |
| nothing starts at all | [MvaveFM1Unbricker](https://github.com/Quixotic7/MvaveFM1Unbricker), [FM-1-transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter) |
